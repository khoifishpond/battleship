# Battleship
### A collaborative effort between Kelsey Thomas and Khoi Nguyen

A playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player. Both the Human Player and the Computer have a 4 x 4 board that holds their ships. Each of them has 2 ships: The Cruiser which is 3 cells long and The Submarine which is 2 cells.
